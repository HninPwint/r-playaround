I design this github workshop into two levels.
 I. Individual git project management level
 II. Team collaboration level
 
 Prilimary Installation ( if it is not done)
 1. Create Git hub account (un/ps)
 2. Install Git in PC
 3. Introduce yourself to Git in your PC (un/ps)
 
 If your installation is done, check your git and its version
 git
 git --version
 
 In web, you should be having your repository url like this - https://github.com/HninPwint
 


I. Individual Project
1. Create a R project
2. In terminal window,
    git init
3. Commit your very first project to your repository
    git status
    git add <<New Files>>
    git 
    



Cloning 
1. Create a project in R-studio
  File -> New Project -> Version Control ->
